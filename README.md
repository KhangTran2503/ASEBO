# ASEBO

This is code to accompany the paper: **From Complexity to Simplicity: Adaptive ES-Active Subspaces for Blackbox Optimization** implementing one version of the ASEBO algorithm. [Here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04268) is the link to the paper: 

It is not the implementation used for the experiments in the paper, which is proprietary, but is a re-implementation which has been tested. The benefit of this is that we use numpy and a single machine, so it should run locally on a laptop. 

We hope you find this useful - if you do, please cite:
